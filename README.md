## [Problem 1:](Number_1.py) 
Circuit Simulator for Resistors in Series and Parallel
### Objective:
Develop a Python program that simulates the behavior of resistors connected in series
and parallel.
### Problem Statement:
In this problem, you will write a Python program to compute the equivalent
resistance of a set of resistors connected in a combination of series and parallel arrangements.

## Problem 2: 
Capacitor Charging and Discharging Simulation in an RC Circuit
Objective: Write a Python program that simulates the charging and discharging process of a
capacitor in a simple RC circuit and displays the voltage across the capacitor at each time step.
### Problem Statement: 
You are tasked with simulating the behavior of a capacitor in an RC circuit (a
resistor and capacitor in series). Your program should calculate and display the voltage across the
capacitor as it charges and discharges over time.
Use the equations for capacitor voltage in an RC circuit during charging and discharging. If possible
also create a plot for these graphs showing the charging and discharging of the capacitor (you can
use pyplot and matplotlib libraries).

## Problem 3: 
Gauss Siedel Method for Load Flow Analysis using Python
